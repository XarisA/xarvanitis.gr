# Midog: A Web App for Managing Dog Health and Care with Ease


## **Simplifying Dog Care, One Reminder at a Time**

In 2015, the concept of **MiDog** was born out of my desire to always be a more responsible dog owner and my anxiety about forgetting something important. Tired of juggling calendar notifications and spreadsheets to keep track of my dog’s needs, I envisioned a streamlined solution: a dedicated web application that could manage dog health and care with ease. 

The idea resonated strongly and led to our winning project at the Greek **AngelHack Hackathon**. Within a 24-hour marathon, my team and I transformed this concept into a functional prototype. 

Here's a photo after winning the event:

Despite our efforts, the project didn’t progress beyond its initial development due to time constraints and logistical challenges. Yet, even in its incomplete form, **MiDog** continues to prove its value to me, easing the anxiety of forgetting important responsibilities and demonstrating the potential of what it could have been.

### **What is MiDog?**

**MiDog** was designed to empower dog owners with tools to manage their pets’ health and care more efficiently. Built as a web application using **Angular**, **JavaScript**, and **MySQL**, it provided users with a seamless way to stay on top of their pet’s needs. Here’s what MiDog could do:

- **Dog Profiles**: Create detailed profiles for each dog, including essential information like breed, age, and medical history.  
- **Customizable Reminders**: Schedule reminders for vaccinations, medical exams, and daily care tasks.  
- **Interactive Calendar**: A calendar view to track all scheduled activities and appointments at a glance.  
- **Medical Records**: Maintain a comprehensive medical profile for your dog, with registered exams and vaccination details.

### **Future Aspirations**

While MiDog laid a strong foundation, there were many ambitious plans that remained unfulfilled:  

- **Analytics and Insights**: Help owners analyze their dogs’ health trends and activity schedules.  
- **Educational Guides**: Provide resources and tips to support responsible dog ownership.  
- **Integration**: Sync seamlessly with third-party calendars and platforms for enhanced convenience.  
- **Data Privacy & Security**: Robust measures to protect users’ data and ensure compliance with modern standards.

### **The Road Ahead**

Although MiDog didn’t go public, the idea continues to inspire. It’s a testament to how technology can make everyday tasks in life easier for pet owners. Whether as a learning experience or a stepping stone for future projects, MiDog stands as a reminder of the power of innovation born out of personal need.

**MiDog** wasn’t just a web app; it was a vision to make dog care stress-free, organized, and accessible. Who knows? The future might still hold a chance for this project to reach its full potential.
