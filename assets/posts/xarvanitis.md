# Building My Portfolio with Angular

When I set out to build my portfolio website, I wanted more than just a space to showcase my work. I envisioned a dynamic platform that would reflect who I am as a developer while also challenging me to expand my skillset. 

## The Why, The What and The How

A blog is essential for anyone with something to say and a desire to express themselves. But why build one from scratch when you can easily use an existing platform or framework?
Well… because I’m a developer! I already have a personal site built with Hugo, but now I want to push my boundaries.

So, why now? Over the past few months, I’ve transitioned into a full-stack developer role. To truly master Angular and deepen my understanding, I need hands-on experience, writing more "miles of" code.

There are many paths to learning, and it’s important to find what works best for you. For me, that means diving into documentation and applying what I’ve learned to build something from scratch. During the creation phase of course you will encounter challenges that force you to to dig deeper and explore further and this is how you expand your knowledge.

You may have ideas about how something should be done, but how do you know if it’s the right way? Is there a recommended approach? Why does one method work better than another? Asking these kinds of questions helps you grow as a developer and better understand the frameworks and tools you use.

This could be challenging but I think that is crucial for any developer who wants to avoid "hitting the wall". While sticking with the same tools and frameworks for years can be comfortable, technology evolves rapidly, and we need to keep up.

Personally, I find watching tutorial videos less effective and more time-consuming. I prefer reading books, though for frameworks and tools, up-to-date documentation and guides are even better. Unlike books, documentation is frequently updated to reflect the latest changes, making it a more reliable learning resource. That said, books remain valuable for foundational or theoretical topics.
